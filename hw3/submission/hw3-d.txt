I would say it's convenient and inconvenient. It's convenient that I don't need
to have some storage that store this "huge" amount of data. But in some sort of
sense, that increase the risk of information disclosure. I claim it's inconvenient
is that I ran into problem when I was doing question 5. I was using the query
editor, which kept giving me timeout exception.
